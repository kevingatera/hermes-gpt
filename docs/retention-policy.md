# Data retention and cleanup policy

Status: current operational policy. Owner: Hermes GPT maintainer.

For documentation authority rules, see [docs/README.md](README.md).

## Scope

This policy covers local diagnostic and orchestration artifacts that can remain on the host even though Mission Control does not return their raw contents.

Mission Control does not return raw request dumps, Codex CLI transcripts, prompts, messages, memory bodies, credentials, or profile-secret bodies.

## Retention windows

| Artifact class | Maximum window | Enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_dump_*.json` | 7 days from file mtime | maintainer cleanup |
| Codex job metadata/transcript artifacts | 30 days after terminal completion | age-based cleanup during Codex job reconciliation |
| terminal Swarm worktrees | 7 days after terminal state and declared artifact preservation | maintainer cleanup through normal Git worktree handling |
| terminal Swarm workflow/verdict records | 30 days after terminal state | maintainer cleanup |
| failed/abandoned workflow records | same windows, measured from last state transition | maintainer cleanup |
| review-acceptance records (`review-evidence/review-acceptances.jsonl`) | 30 days after the contract they evidence reaches terminal state | maintainer cleanup; see below |
| event timeline | derived read model with no stored copy; query window `HERMES_GPT_EVENTS_MAX_AGE_DAYS` (default 90) | enforced at query time by the event tools |
| durable token store (`secrets/hermes_gpt_tokens.db`) | live rows until expired; retirement tombstones kept permanently | revocation via `hermes_oauth_revoke`; see below |

### Review-evidence records

Review-acceptance records are append-only and never rewritten in place. They
contain identity and references only, with no raw prompts, transcripts, or
bodies.
Cleanup follows the same conservative procedure as other classes: confirm the
evidenced contract is terminal and no legal hold applies, then remove the
record. Its retention window follows the contract records it evidences.

### Durable token store

The encrypted token store at `<hermes_data>/secrets/hermes_gpt_tokens.db`
(0600) is revoked through the Owner-gated `hermes_oauth_revoke` tool. Revocation
retires token rows, advances the revocation epoch, and optionally rotates the
master key. Token-store commits remove expired live rows; retirement tombstones
remain permanently. There is no background purge. The store owns these writes,
and the `secrets/` directory stays denied to file tools. See
[OAuth key management](oauth.md#durable-storage) for the key lookup order.

### Event timeline

`hermes_events_*` is a derived read-model: it normalizes the durable stores
listed above at query time and keeps no stored copy of its own. The query
window (default 90 days, `HERMES_GPT_EVENTS_MAX_AGE_DAYS`) is enforced at
query time. The effective window is the minimum of the configured window and
each source's own retention (for example, Codex jobs age out after 30 days),
so an event older than its source cannot be returned even if the configured
window is larger.

### Codex-specific automatic cleanup

`src/hermes_gpt/execution/codex.py` defines `RETENTION_DAYS=30` and performs
age-based cleanup as part of job reconciliation. It is not a general background
deletion daemon: nothing in this class ages out unless a reconciliation pass
runs.

### Other artifact classes

No global cleanup service handles request dumps, Swarm worktrees, Swarm
workflow/verdict records, or review-acceptance records. The maintainer remains
responsible for keeping those classes within the stated windows unless later
code adds and tests automation.

## Cleanup procedure

1. Run cleanup locally under the authenticated maintainer account.
2. Identify candidates only inside the expected artifact directories and use mtime / terminal timestamps rather than opening sensitive content.
3. Confirm the item is outside its retention window and is no longer required by an active workflow.
4. For Swarm worktrees, first confirm the workflow is terminal and declared artifacts have been copied to the owning repository or attached to the intended work record.
5. Remove worktrees through the repository's normal worktree cleanup path.
6. Record only bounded operational metadata in the maintenance/audit receipt, such as aggregate counts, safe IDs/paths, and timestamps.
7. Never copy raw prompt, transcript, request, credential, or secret content into the audit record or client response.

## Exceptions

If an artifact is subject to an investigation, legal hold, or active incident response:

- suspend deletion for that specific item;
- record the exception and responsible owner using bounded metadata;
- do not broaden the exception to unrelated artifacts.

## Release and compliance posture

This is an operational retention policy, not a claim of legal or regulatory compliance.

Any future cleanup automation must remain:

- path-allowlisted;
- bounded;
- independently tested;
- auditable;
- conservative around active workflows and legal-hold exceptions.

If documentation and implementation disagree about cleanup behavior, verify
`src/hermes_gpt/execution/codex.py`, the Swarm store code, and the relevant tests
before changing the claim.
