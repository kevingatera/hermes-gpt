# Binary file export

`hermes_export_file(path)` transfers one existing local file to a trusted MCP client as an MCP-native embedded binary resource.

Use it for spreadsheets, PDFs, archives, images, and other binary outputs.
Export requires Operator `workspace` authority: transferring bytes can disclose
data even though the file is not changed.

## Security contract

A file is exportable only when all of these conditions are true:

- `HERMES_GPT_OPERATOR_ENABLED=1`;
- `HERMES_GPT_OPERATOR_LEVEL=workspace` or `owner`;
- `HERMES_GPT_OPERATOR_ALLOWED_PATHS` is non-empty;
- the fully resolved file path remains under one of those allowed roots;
- the resolved path is not denied by the existing secret/credential/vault/token path policy;
- the file is a regular file;
- the file is within the configured byte limit;
- when an extension allowlist is configured, the file suffix is allowed.

Owner Mode does not bypass the denied-path policy.

Unlike `hermes_workspace_read`, binary export does not fall back to broad non-secret filesystem reads when `HERMES_GPT_OPERATOR_ALLOWED_PATHS` is empty. A non-empty workspace root is mandatory.

## Size limits

The default maximum is 4 MiB. Override it with a byte count:

```text
HERMES_GPT_EXPORT_MAX_BYTES=8388608
```

The hard ceiling is 16 MiB. Values above the hard ceiling, zero/negative values, and invalid integers fail closed.

Hermes GPT checks the file size before opening it and also reads at most one byte beyond the configured limit so a file that grows between the metadata check and the read cannot silently exceed the cap.

## Optional extension allowlist

Leave `HERMES_GPT_EXPORT_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` unset to allow any file extension that passes the workspace and denied-path checks.

To restrict file types:

```text
HERMES_GPT_EXPORT_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS=.pdf,.xlsx,.png,.zip
```

Leading dots are optional and matching is case-insensitive. If the variable is set but contains no valid extensions, export fails closed.

## MCP result shape

A successful call returns safe structured metadata including:

- `filename`
- `mime_type`
- `size_bytes`
- `sha256`
- an opaque `hermes-export://sha256/...` resource URI
- `transfer: "mcp_embedded_resource"`
- `client_rendering: "client-controlled"`

The file bytes are returned only as:

```text
CallToolResult
  -> EmbeddedResource
     -> BlobResourceContents
```

The local absolute path is not returned to the MCP client. The base64 representation required by the MCP wire format is not duplicated into text or structured metadata.

A client that cannot render the resource gets no text or base64 fallback.

## Client rendering

The MCP result contains the embedded binary resource. Each client decides how
it displays that resource. A successful transfer does not prove the client will
show a download button, attachment, or preview.

## Audit behavior

Every success or refusal is audited through the Operator audit system.

Successful records include bounded metadata such as MIME type, byte size, and SHA-256. The existing audit path summarizer records only a basename/length summary rather than the full local path. Raw binary contents and base64 payloads are never written to the audit record.

## Example

With an approved workspace:

```text
HERMES_GPT_OPERATOR_ENABLED=1
HERMES_GPT_OPERATOR_LEVEL=workspace
HERMES_GPT_OPERATOR_ALLOWED_PATHS=C:\work\reports
```

A trusted MCP client can call:

```text
hermes_export_file(path="C:\work\reports\quarterly.xlsx")
```

The tool refuses the same file when it is outside the approved root, resolves through a symlink outside the root, matches a denied secret path, exceeds the byte limit, or violates an optional extension allowlist.
